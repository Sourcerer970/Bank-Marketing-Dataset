Here is a machine learning project I did with the Bank Marketing Datset from the UCI Machine Learning Respository using R and Python. I used logistic regression to predict if a
client will subscribe a term deposit. Since there are no missing values in this datset, I went straight to exporatory data analysis and did several graphs using the ggplot2
package. After that, I used the the caTools package to train-test split the data with a 70/30 percent ratio split. After training the model and used it to predict with 
the test data, I calculated the accuracy, precision, and recall based on the confusion matrix.
